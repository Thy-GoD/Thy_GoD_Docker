    # This part can be edited to have Variable values, to allow greater customization. 
    # Note that --cap-add=NET_ADMIN is used to give the docker container more perms, port:port is used to bind docker ports to host ports.
    # -v PWD (Current Working Directory) is used to create a shared folder, you can change this bit, but I doubt you have to.
    # I can add plans to allow ports to be manually configurable, but honestly you can just change them here to make them permament changes.
    # Instead of needing to specify them each time.
    # Well technically I can make them permanent but o well.
    # FYI you can add '--rm' to remove the container and all of it's contents once you exit it.
    # Update: It is recommended to run xhost +local:$(id -nu) to allow the docker container to use the host's display.
    # This is run automatically by default, tho.
    # Update2: Added an argument to run the container with host networking instead, to make LLMNR and DHCPv6 poisoning more convenient.
