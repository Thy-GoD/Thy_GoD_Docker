# Thigh_Terminal / Thy_GoD_Docker

Is a Personal Docker Image  with Pentest tools and zsh plugins, inspired by Nutek-Terminal and runs on a base Kali Image.

There's also autocomplete and auto syntax highlighting on zsh, with a "cls" clear && ls -a alias.

Feel free to use this to make your own docker projects or whatever. 

(report bugs)

## How to use:

I've made it quite easy, simply run the tools.sh file, (preferably as root to avoid any conflicts).

This obviously requires docker installed.

This will start to build the docker image, once it's done it'll put you inside the container.

You can make this container as a "terminal" by creating a shortcut that runs the tools.sh file.

tools.sh automatically starts the container, enters a running container, and stops the docker container when the "exit" command is used.

Container has not been tested with tmux, but Konsole's split view instead. 

## Note: 

I will occasionally make changes to the container, in order to optimize, add, edit, or fix bugs.
Btw, ports 8888,6969,8889,8080,9090 and 8585 are binded/used by default.
