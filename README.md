# Thigh_Terminal / Thy_GoD_Docker

Is a Personal Docker Image  with Pentest tools and zsh plugins, inspired by Nutek-Terminal and runs on a base Kali Image.

There's also autocomplete and auto syntax highlighting on zsh, with a "cls" clear && ls -a alias.

Feel free to use this to make your own docker images or whatever.
